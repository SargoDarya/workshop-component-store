# Component Store Workshop

Companion project for the component store workshop that can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zk8Yb9nJF-8HXq9B7Mi_A0Ilgv93mq8SdoT-qAGS6Po/edit?usp=sharing

## Navigating the project

The basic scaffolding will be in the main branch. You can follow along the workshop by checking out the project and work along or switch to a different branch to see the final implementation for reference.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
